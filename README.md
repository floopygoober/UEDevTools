# UEDevTools
stuff for team project, and other useful tools i may develop in the future

I developed the unreal builder first because I made the mistake of starting on a tool before reading the requirements for the assignment. oof.
I have had a hard time thinking of what kind of dev tool i would need to create for our project to be honest so this seemed like a good place to start but it is more just review
I did learn a bit more about the flags that are used when running the command line code to generate a ue project but i fear this is not enough so now i need to think of a python tool to add as well. 

UPDATE 
Had an idea to clean up unnecessary garbage in the levels if its accidentally generated. stuff that has slipped by me in the past is duplicate objects being inside of each other so 
a visual inspection could possibly miss this. with our game being destruction heavy this could really mess us up in performance. so i decided id make a tool to detect the same mesh overlapping itself
added a tolerance to it so that if its off ever so slightly we can still detect it. 
Definitely liking how many libraries python has because it makes somewhat complex things super easy. love how easy the documentation is to find as well!
