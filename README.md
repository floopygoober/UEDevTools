# UEDevTools
stuff for team project, and other useful tools i may develope in the future

I developed the unreal builder first because I made the mistake of starting on a tool before reading the requirements for the assignment. oof.
I have had a hard time thinking of what kind of dev tool i would need to create for our project to be honest so this seemed like a good place to start but it is more just review
I did learn a bit more about the flags that are used when running the command line code to generate a ue project but i fear this is not enough so now i need to think of a python tool to add as well.
